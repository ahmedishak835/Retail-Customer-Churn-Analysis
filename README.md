# Retail Customer Churn Analysis & Consultancy Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a data consultancy engagement for a retail client. The goal was to identify key drivers of customer churn and provide actionable business recommendations to improve retention.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Data manipulation (Pandas) and Visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib).
- **SQL (SQLite):** Complex data aggregation and revenue impact analysis.
- **Excel:** Final stakeholder deliverable and executive summary.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Churn Rate:** An overall churn rate of ~27% was identified across the 1,000-customer sample.
- **High-Risk Segment:** Contrary to expectations, One-Year contract holders showed a slightly higher churn rate (28.1%), suggesting a "service dip" during the contract term.
- **Pain Points:** A strong correlation was found between the number of **Support Tickets** and Churn, with 4+ tickets being a critical threshold for customer exit.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
1. **Support Threshold Alerts:** Flag accounts reaching 3+ support tickets for immediate "white-glove" service intervention.
2. **Contract Anniversary Incentives:** Implement loyalty rewards at the 10-month mark for annual contracts to reduce renewal churn.
3. **Data Integrity:** Automated Python workflows were built to handle missing financial data, ensuring 100% reporting accuracy.
